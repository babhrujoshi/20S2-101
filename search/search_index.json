There are other free online textbooks you can refer to as well. See here Course description \u00b6 Sequences and limits; Riemann sums; definite and indefinite integration; the fundamental theorem of calculus; substitution methods; improper integrals; work, volume, and centroids; integration by parts; partial fraction decomposition; approximation of integrals; separable differential equations; series; convergence tests; absolute and conditional convergence; Taylor series; power series. Course requirements \u00b6 One of MATH 100, MATH 102, MATH 104, MATH 110, MATH 120, MATH 180, MATH 184. Course discussion board \u00b6 Discussion board is hosted on Piazza Course Structure \u00b6 This course will be conducted entirely online. For most lectures, pre-recorded videos will be posted on Canvas before class. You are expected to watch these videos before attending the online lectures. Online lectures will be discussion based where we expand on topics covered in the videos. Online Etiquette \u00b6 During class, students should be fully engaged with the class, to the best of their ability. Students are expected to leave their video connection on for the majority of class. If this is not possible, please consult with the instructor and an accommodation will be made on a case by case basis. Participants should mute themselves when they are not speaking. Participants should willingly volunteer to answer questions and should be prepared to be called upon to answer questions if needed.","title":"Home Page"},{"location":"#integral-calculus","text":"This is the web site for MATH 101 Term 2 of the 2020S session (July to August 2020).","title":"Integral Calculus"},{"location":"#lectures","text":"Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays: 10-12 am Wednesdays: 10-11 am Location: Online","title":"Lectures"},{"location":"#teaching-staff-2020-summer-term-2","text":"Instructor: Babhru Joshi Office hours: Online Mondays and Fridays: 3-4 pm or by appointment Teaching assistant: Pulkit Gandhi","title":"Teaching staff (2020 Summer Term 2)"},{"location":"#textbook","text":"We will be using CLP-2 Integral Calculus by Joel Feldman, Andrew Rechnitzer, and Elyse Yeager.

If you have collaborated or consulted with someone while working on your assignment, you must acknowledge this explicitly in your submitted assignment. If you are unsure about any of these rules, feel free to consult with your instructor. Late homework submissions \u00b6 Each student has a three lecture-day allowance to use throughout the term. For instance, if an assignment is due by Thursday, then submission by Friday counts as one delay; a submission by Monday counts as two delays; a submission by the following Wednesday counts as three delays (and consumes the entire three-day allowance). Apart from using delays, late submissions are not accepted. Once a solution set has been posted, no more late submissions are permitted; consequently, you may not always be able to use all of your delays. Policies \u00b6 No makeup exam for quizzes or the final exam. If you missed a quiz you must document a justification. Lowest quiz grade will be dropped and only highest 4 of the 5 quizzes will count towards the quiz grade. To pass the course you must do the assigned coursework, write the quiz and final exams, pass the final exam, and obtain an overall pass average according to the grading scheme. The instructors reserve the right to modify the grading scheme at any time.","title":"Grades"},{"location":"grades/#grades-and-policies","text":"","title":"Grades and policies"},{"location":"grades/#grade-distribution","text":"assignments (Webwork): 20% quizzes (5): 40% final exam: 40%","title":"Grade distribution"},{"location":"grades/#collaboration","text":"You may collaborate and consult with other students in the course, but you must work on your own assignments.
