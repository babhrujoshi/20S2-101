Online lectures will be discussion based where we expand on topics covered in the videos. Online Etiquette \u00b6 During class, students should be fully engaged with the class, to the best of their ability. Students are expected to leave their video connection on for the majority of class. If this is not possible, please consult with the instructor and an accommodation will be made on a case by case basis. Participants should mute themselves when they are not speaking. Participants should willingly volunteer to answer questions and should be prepared to be called upon to answer questions if needed.","title":"Home Page"},{"location":"#integral-calculus","text":"This is the web site for MATH 101 Term 2 of the 2020S session (July to August 2020).","title":"Integral Calculus"},{"location":"#lectures","text":"Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays: 10-12 am Wednesdays: 10-11 am Location: Online, see Canvas or Piazza for links (Piazza access code is 2020951).","title":"Lectures"},{"location":"#teaching-staff-2020-summer-term-2","text":"Instructor: Babhru Joshi Office hours: Mondays, Fridays: 3-4 pm and Tuesdays: 10-11 am or by appointment.

The solutions for the problem are available in book, but you should always solve the problem before checking your answer. The material in the problem book is extremely well organized, with Questions, Hints, Answers, and Solutions. Indeed, reading the \u201cHow to use this book\u201d introduction alone will probably significantly increase your understanding of how to master university-level mathematics. Solving these problem will also help you prepare for tests. Most of these problems are challenging and will reflect the level of difficult of the questions in tests.
