# Grades and policies

##  Grade distribution

* assignments (Webwork): 20%
* quizzes (5): 40%
* final exam: 40%

## Collaboration

You may collaborate and consult with other students in the course, but you must hand in your own assignments and your own code. If you have collaborated or consulted with someone while working on your assignment, you must acknowledge this explicitly in your submitted assignment. If you are unsure about any of these rules, feel free to consult with your instructor or visit the departmental webpage on [Collaboration and Plagiarism](https://my.cs.ubc.ca/docs/collaboration-plagiarism).

## Late homework submissions

Each student has a three lecture-day allowance to use throughout the term. For instance, if an assignment is due by Thursday, then submission by Friday counts as one delay; a submission by Monday counts as two delays; a submission by the following Wednesday counts as three delays (and consumes the entire three-day allowance). Apart from using delays, late submissions are not accepted. Once a solution set has been posted, no more late submissions are permitted; consequently, you may not always be able to use all of your delays.

## Policies

* No makeup exam for quizzes or the final exam. If you missed a quiz you must document a justification.

* Lowest quiz grade will be dropped and only highest 4 of the 5 quizzes will count towards the quiz grade. 

* To pass the course you must do the assigned coursework, write the quiz and final exams, pass the final exam, and obtain an overall pass average according to the grading scheme.

* The instructors reserve the right to modify the grading scheme at any time.
